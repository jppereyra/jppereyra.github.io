Besides merely being a finite set of rules that gives a sequence of operations for solving a specific type of problem, an algorithm has five important features â€” The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 1, p. 4.</blockquote><p>In summary, those 5 features are:<ul><li>Finiteness. It must always terminate after a finite number of steps. It can't run forever.<li>Definiteness. Each step must be precisely defined; the actions to be carried out must be rigorously and unambiguously specified for each case.<li>Input. It has zero or more inputs. Values may be given to the algorithm before it begins to use as an input.<li>Output. It has at least one output, and said output or outputs will have a relation to the input.</ul><p>These definitions are valid across all programming languages; they are fundamental in nature.<p>In addition to those 5 features, and algorithm will likely make use of intermediary calculated values, or variables. And a useful way to design and test an algorithm, is by running through an example. For instance, let's say I want to make an algorithm to calculate the factorial of a number, I may write something like:<pre class=z-code><code><span class="z-text z-plain">name: factorial
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">inputs: n
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">outputs: result
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">n &lt; 0 -> result is not defined
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">n = 0 -> result = 1
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">n > 0 -> result = factorial of (n-1)
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">description: I will multiply 1, 2, 3, 4... up to n and return it as a result.
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">define auxiliary variable: i
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">1: if n is &lt; 0 return an error, as this is undefined
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">2: result = 1, i = 1
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">3: if n equals 0 return result and end execution here, otherwise continue
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">4: if i > n return result, otherwise continue
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">5: multiply result by i, store it in result
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">6: increment i by 1
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">7: go to line 4
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">test:
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">factorial of 5
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">1:  5 is not negative, so we continue
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">2:  result = 1, i = 1
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">3:  5 is greater than 0, so we continue
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">4:  i is 1 and 1 &lt; 5, so we continue
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">5:  1 * 1 = 1, result = 1
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">6:  i = 2
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">7:  i is 2 and 2 &lt; 5, so we continue
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">8:  1 * 2 = 2, result = 2
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">9:  i = 3
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">10: i is 3 and 3 &lt; 5, so we continue
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">11: 2 * 3 = 6, result = 6
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">12: i = 4
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">13: i is 4 and 4 &lt; 5, so we continue
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">14: 6 * 4 = 24, result = 24
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">15: i = 5
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">16: i is 5 and 5 = 5, so we continue
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">17: 24 * 5 = 120, result = 120
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">18: i = 6
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">19: i is 6, 6 > 5 so we stop execution and return result
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">result = 120

I read somewhere that Nikola Tesla was known to devise entire machine designs in his head, and then build them directly; which is definitely not how it works for me.<p>Give a try!</section></article></main></div></div><div class=right-content></div>
